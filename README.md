# Welsh-Powell-Algorithm

## Inittialize Graph
```bash
- Number of vertex or File
```

## Add Vertice & Create adjacency matrix
```bash
- Add manually in main or Add from file 
```

## Welsh-Powell Algorithm
```bash
- Create Array of colors and sorting the adjacency matrix by number of adjacencies
- Running the Wels Powell algorithm
```

## Draw Graph or Create text file of Welsh-Powell Algorithm
```bash
- Draw graph if number of vertices less than 100
- Write in file if number of vestices more than 100
```
